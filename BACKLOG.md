# Carelog — Master Backlog

> **This is the single source of truth for all planned work.** Every task — feature, bug, tech debt, infra, polish — is tracked here with a lifecycle status. Read this file **before** starting any task. Update it **immediately** when status changes. If it isn't here, it isn't planned. Run `/backlog-sync` at least once a day (and on session start) to reconcile against git/PRs.

Last consolidated: **2026-04-16** (codebase scan same day). Last `/backlog-sync`: **2026-04-25**.

Replaces: `OVERNIGHT_BACKLOG.md`, `BACKLOG_PHASE2–5.md`, `BACKLOG_UI_REDESIGN.md`, `docs/superpowers/plans/CLAUDE_BACKLOG.md`. `BUILD_STATUS.md` and `TECH_DEBT.md` are **historical logs only** — new work is tracked here.

Human account-signup tasks (Supabase/Vercel/Stripe/etc.) live in `docs/project-info/runbooks/THIRD_PARTY_SETUP.md` and are referenced from §8.

## Legend

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 🟢 | **Ready** — scoped, unblocked, not yet picked up |
| ⚡ | **In progress** — an agent or human is actively working on it |
| 🔎 | **In review** — PR open, awaiting review or CI |
| 🌙 | **Overnight-eligible** — picked up by the nightly agent (2 am CT / 8 am UTC). Must be mechanical, low risk, no shared-state conflicts. |
| 🧊 | **Deferred** — intentionally parked |
| ✅ | **Shipped** — moved to §7 |
| 🔴 | **Blocked** — prerequisite open; note `Blocked by:` inline |
| 🧑 | **Needs human** — account signup, env var, click-through — see §8 |

Every active row **must** include a `Status:` field (`Ready` / `In progress` / `In review` / `Blocked` / `Shipped`) and, when applicable, `Owner:` (agent name, human, or `nightly`) and `Branch:`/`PR:` once work starts. `/backlog-sync` fills what it can infer.

**Story-ID prefixes**
- `ON-*` — overnight-originated stories (mobile a11y, mechanical sweeps, large features)
- `PP-*` — platform parity (web/iOS/Android)
- `A11Y-*` — accessibility tooling
- `UX-*` — deferred UI redesign polish
- `TD-*` — tech debt (newly opened; historical items live in `docs/project-info/technology/TECH_DEBT.md`)
- `P2-*`..`P5-*` — phase backlogs (all shipped, retained as a log in §7)
- `B*`/`D*`/`A*`/`C*` — before-launch Claude tasks (shipped where no 🧑 gate)

## 1. Active / next-up

| ID | Status | Owner | Branch / PR | Story | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ON-49 | ✅ Shipped · PR #108 | — | — | **Shift completion → handoff note prompt** | When a shift transitions to `completed`, show inline prompt (web ShiftList + mobile schedule) for an optional handoff note. Creates a `care_event` with `entry_type='handoff'`. The `handoff` enum value already exists in the DB. |
| ON-50 | ✅ Shipped · PR #106 | — | — | **Weekly digest: medications adherence section** | Add a missed-dose summary to the Sunday Inngest digest. Query `care_events` for `event_type='medication'` last week, surface missed vs given count. `weeklyDigest.ts` already has journal + mood + shifts but no meds section. |
| ON-51 | ✅ Shipped · PR #109 | — | — | **Aide recipient-scoping in invite + team admin** | When inviting as role='aide', show a recipient picker that sets `recipient_id` on the membership row. DB already has `recipient_id` on `memberships` with an index; the invite form and TeamAdmin currently ignore it. |
| ON-52 | ✅ Shipped · PR #101 | — | — | **Care history depth counter on dashboard** | Shows care event count + months of history per team; parallel Supabase queries + `formatCareStats` pure helper + 6 unit tests. |
| ON-53 | ✅ Shipped · PR #100 | — | — | **CareZone alternative landing page** | `/carezone-alternative` hero, CareZone comparison table, medication import preview tool; MarketingNav linked ("CareZone users"). |
| ON-57 | ✅ Shipped · PR #105 | — | — | **Family referral share link** | Coordinator dashboard button: "Refer Carelog to another family." Generates a shareable `/signup?ref=<orgSlug>` URL (new-org referral, not a team invite). PostHog tracks `referral_shared` + `referral_converted` events. Referral source stored on new org row. Key KPI: 60% referral rate by month 6 (PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md). ~1 day. |
| ON-58 | ✅ Shipped · PR #103 | — | — | **Analytics: onboarding + retention funnel events** | Add PostHog events: `onboarding_step_completed` (step name, elapsed_ms), `first_care_event_created` (elapsed_ms since signup), `team_member_invited` (team_size property). Powers PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md KPIs: "time to first care event < 10 min" + "week 4 retention 70%+." PHI rule: UUID only — no names or emails. ~0.5 day. |

### New tech-debt (TD-*) — opened 2026-04-14

| ID | Status | Story | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| TD-02 | ✅ Shipped · PR #87 | **Dynamic Type + screen-reader audit (mobile)** | scaledFont + accessibilityLabel sweep shipped. Physical device VoiceOver verification deferred to human. |
| TD-03 | 🟢 Ready | **Sentry source maps upload** | BUILD_STATUS: "source maps pending `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`". Needs 🧑 env var in Vercel. |
| TD-12 | ✅ Shipped · PR #118 | **Fix missing Dialog + Label UI components** | Created `dialog.tsx` + `label.tsx` wrapping @base-ui/react; unskipped test files. |
| TD-13 | ✅ Shipped · PR #116 | **CommentThread mutation error handling** | Added `onError: () => toast.error(...)` to add/edit/remove mutations; 3 new tests. |
| TD-11 | ✅ Shipped · 2026-04-17 | **data-testid sweep for medication components** | All data-testids already existed in MedicationPanel.tsx + MedicationChecklist.tsx; e2e spec already uses them. No code changes needed. |
| TD-06 | ✅ Shipped · PR #98 | **Add `dark:` variants to ON-44/ON-45 components** | dark: sweep across Comment + TradeRequest components; contrast patch (avatar/badge gray-900+gray-50, fixed hover) committed directly to main. |
| TD-07 | ✅ Shipped · PR #94 | **Alert → Toast sweep** | Replaced 6 `alert()` calls with sonner toasts across JournalClient, settings, subscriptions, TeamAdmin. Invite URL now copies to clipboard before toast. |
| TD-08 | ✅ Shipped · PR #95 | **Supabase types regen + `as any` cleanup** | Regenerated `database.types.ts`; removed 10 `as any` casts from `careEventCommentsRepository.ts`. |
| TD-09 | ✅ Shipped · PR #96 | **ShiftList edit mode** | Added `shifts.update` tRPC mutation + ShiftForm edit-mode props + inline edit panel in ShiftList with `editingShift` state. |
| TD-10 | ✅ Shipped · PR #97 | **JournalClient refactor** | Extracted `useJournalData`, `useOfflineQueue`, `useJournalActions` hooks + `JournalLayout` component. JournalClient.tsx: 624 → 107 lines. |
| TD-14 | ✅ Shipped · PR #132 | **Restore green CI: clear 491 lint errors** | Downgraded `no-explicit-any`, `no-unescaped-entities`, `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` to warn; hand-fixed 6 remaining errors (`@ts-ignore` → `@ts-expect-error`, targeted a11y disables in `ShiftPopover.tsx`). Contrast script token-drift bug (`#ef4444` vs `#c41a1a`) fixed in same PR. 1010 tests green. |
| TD-15 | ✅ Shipped · PR #131 | **Fix CI infra: lockfile drift + workflow script-name bugs** | (a) `apps/mobile/package.json` had `expo-web-browser` declared without lockfile regen → every CI job failed at `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`. Fixed by `pnpm install`. (b) `.github/workflows/ci.yml` Typecheck job ran `pnpm typecheck` (typo, root script is `type-check`). (c) Web-tests job ran `pnpm test:coverage` from `apps/web/` (script lives at root). Both fixed by matching the local pre-commit hook pattern (`npx vitest run` from apps/web). |
| TD-16 | ✅ Shipped · PR #132 + #134 | **Clear web typecheck errors + wire CI to catch them** | PR #132 cut `apps/web` tsc errors 147→43 (Next.js 15 Promise params, Supabase types, vitest-globals.d.ts). PR #134 drove remaining 43→0 across 27 files; updated CI workflow to run `cd apps/web && npx tsc --noEmit` instead of silently skipping (root script only covers root). 1111 tests green. |
| TD-17 | ✅ Shipped · PR #141 | **Green mobile Jest suite + CI on PRs** | 7 test files red, 11 tests. Root causes: (1) `scaledFont` missing `Math.round()` → float output; (2) `expo-device` not in pnpm store → virtual mock needed; (3) 5 screen tests had stale empty-state text + schedule trpc mock missing `useUtils`/`shiftTradeRequests`/`completeMutation`; (4) `usePushNotifications` simulator test used dynamic `import()` incompatible with Jest CJS transform; (5) Journal BottomSheet uses Modal+Animated which test-renderer can't pierce — mocked inline. CI `mobile-tests` job already runs on `pull_request:` trigger (confirmed, no yml change needed). |
| TD-20 | ✅ Shipped · PR #140 | **Restore 4 quarantined RLS pgTAP tests** | `ai_conversations_rls`, `education_tip_cache_rls`, `medication_tagging_rls`, `shift_trade_requests_rls` — replaced non-existent `tests.create_supabase_user()` helper with canonical `INSERT INTO auth.users` + `SET LOCAL ROLE` + JWT pattern; fixed invalid (non-hex) UUID literals; corrected `shifts` table column names; `_quarantined-tests/` dir now empty. |
| TD-21 | ✅ Shipped (partial) · PR #148 | **CVE bumps shipped; flip-to-blocking deferred to TD-29** | Bumped Next.js → 16.2.3, protobufjs → 8.0.1 (via root pnpm override), @xmldom/xmldom → 0.9.10 (via root pnpm override). Flipping scanners to blocking surfaced ~25 long-tail transitive findings — reverted to warn-only with TD-29 follow-up. The CRITICAL RCE + DoS bumps still landed. |
| TD-23 | ✅ Shipped · PR #148 | **SHA-pin all workflow action refs + checksum OSV binary** | Pinned 5 actions across both `security.yml` and `ci.yml` to immutable SHAs (with `# v1.2.3` end-of-line comments): `actions/checkout@v4.2.2`, `actions/setup-node@v4.4.0`, `pnpm/action-setup@v3.0.0`, `gitleaks/gitleaks-action@v2.3.9`, `aquasecurity/trivy-action@v0.30.0`. Added `sha256sum -c` against `c52d68f8...` for the OSV binary download — fails loudly on mismatch. |
| TD-29 | 🟢 Ready | **Long-tail transitive vuln triage (followup to TD-21)** | Surfaced when TD-21 flipped scanners to blocking on 2026-04-25; reverted to warn-only after PR #148 merged. Three classes: (1) `apps/web/pnpm-lock.yaml` is a separate lockfile not refreshed by root `pnpm install` — needs `cd apps/web && pnpm install` or unification; (2) `apps/mobile/package-lock.json` is npm-format not pnpm — pnpm overrides don't apply, need `apps/mobile/package.json` direct bumps; (3) root has dompurify / follow-redirects / hono / vite / postcss / uuid HIGH advisories not covered by current overrides. After triage, remove `continue-on-error` from OSV/Trivy/pnpm-audit jobs in `security.yml` (look for `# TD-29` comments). ~0.5 day. |
| TD-22 | ✅ Shipped · PR #147 | **Billing tRPC router (unblocks PP-014)** | `apps/web/server/routers/billing.ts` — `billing.getSubscription` query reads org plan + seat count from `organizations` + `memberships` tables; registered on `appRouter`; 4 tests (happy path, no-membership null, free-plan null, UNAUTHORIZED). No Stripe API call; no new migration. |

### Test gap stories (TD-24..28) — opened 2026-04-25 from coverage analysis

Snapshot at filing time: web 66.74% / mobile 78.53% / RLS 211 tests across 26 files. These five close the highest-leverage PHI/auth/payment gaps. ~12 hr total. **Target after this batch ships:** web ≥78%, mobile ≥85%, RLS adds 2 dedicated PHI-table files.

| ID | Status | Story | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| TD-24 | 🟢 Ready | **`care_events_rls.test.sql`** | `care_events` is the most-frequently-written PHI table (every journal entry) and has NO dedicated RLS test file today (only `care_event_comments` does). A cross-recipient SELECT/INSERT leak would be silent in CI. Test coordinator/aide/outer-circle SELECT and INSERT isolation — especially the cross-recipient leak vector. ~2 hr. |
| TD-25 | 🟢 Ready | **`supabaseServer` session-refresh unit test** | New file: `apps/web/lib/__tests__/supabaseServer.test.ts`. Cookie-API regressions from Next.js or `@supabase/ssr` upgrades currently have no regression net (route tests mock the client). Simulate expired `access_token` + valid `refresh_token` in cookies, verify a new session is returned (or 401 thrown cleanly). Silent-break vector for ALL SSR routes. ~3 hr. |
| TD-26 | 🟢 Ready | **`useOfflineWrite` error/retry branch coverage** | Branch coverage is 50% (lines 79-80, 87, 95-96 — the offline retry and error-clear paths). Exactly the code that runs during intermittent connectivity, the most common mobile failure mode. Test: network failure mid-sync (queue not removed), repeated retry on permanent 4xx, queue clear on success. ~2 hr. |
| TD-27 | 🟢 Ready | **Aide cross-recipient scoping integration test** | New file: `apps/web/server/routers/__tests__/careEventsRouter.scope.test.ts`. RLS covers DB-layer isolation but the tRPC `where` clause is untested for cross-org isolation. Use a real local DB; assert `careEvents.list` called with a `recipient_id` the aide is NOT a member of returns empty (or 403), not data. ~3 hr. |
| TD-28 | 🟢 Ready | **`messagingPush` + `educationTipRefresh` Inngest failure tests** | These are the only 2 Inngest functions with zero test coverage (out of 11). `messagingPush` fans out push notifications to potentially all family members — an unhandled `DeviceNotRegistered` error would silently drop the job. Test malformed payload + `DeviceNotRegistered` + Expo API timeout. ~2 hr. |

### Roadmap features (ON-64..68) — opened 2026-04-25

From `docs/project-info/product/ROADMAP.md` Phases 3–5. Greenlit 2026-04-25 to add to Ready queue. Sequencing rationale per ROADMAP.md §"Feature sequencing rationale".

| ID | Status | Story | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| ON-64 | 🟢 Ready | **Care brief generation pipeline (Phase 3)** | The viewer page `/brief/[shareToken]/page.tsx` exists, but the *generator* that builds a snapshot from `identity_vault` + `medications` + `documents` and emits a signed share URL isn't wired. Per ROADMAP.md §Phase 3: de-tokenization happens ONCE at generation time; the stored snapshot has real names; the vault is never accessed at view time. New: `apps/web/app/api/brief/generate/route.ts` + `lib/buildCareBrief.ts` (pure helper) + Supabase row in `care_briefs` table (may need migration). Coordinator dashboard "Generate brief" button. ~2 days incl. RLS test + pgTAP. |
| ON-65 | 🟢 Ready | **Refill alerts (Phase 3)** | Inngest nightly job: find `medications WHERE supply_days_remaining <= 7`. Send notification to coordinator + assigned caregiver with pharmacy contact pre-populated. Idempotency key: `refill:{medication_id}:{week_stamp}`. New: `apps/web/inngest/functions/medicationRefillAlerts.ts` + test. Schema is ready (`supply_days_remaining` column exists). ~1 day. |
| ON-66 | 🟢 Ready | **Symptom tracker (Phase 4)** | Log pain (0-10), mood, appetite, mobility, vitals (BP, pulse, temp). Trend view shows status over time. Flagged symptoms surface in doctor export. Schema: extend existing `care_events.event_type` enum with `symptom` + jsonb payload OR create dedicated `symptoms` table (decide in plan; `symptoms.ts` router skeleton already exists per `apps/web/server/routers/`). Web journal panel + mobile screen. ~3 days. |
| ON-67 | 🟢 Ready | **Burnout tracker (Phase 4) — the differentiator** | ROADMAP.md: *"the differentiator nobody else builds. CareZone didn't. Caring Village doesn't."* Weekly check-in for the CAREGIVER (not recipient): sleep score, stress score, support score. If 2-week trend is bad, surface respite resources. New table `caregiver_wellbeing` (member_id, week_stamp, scores, created_at) + RLS (member sees only own). Inngest weekly reminder. UI: prompt in TopBar Sunday + dedicated `/wellbeing` route. ~3 days. |
| ON-68 | 🟢 Ready | **Document vault (Phase 5)** | Encrypted storage for HIPAA auth, POA, advance directive, insurance cards, medication list. Documents schema exists (`documents` table + RLS); needs vault-specific UI surface that aggregates by category, plus a "share with new aide" workflow that generates a time-limited signed URL. ~2.5 days. |

Source: external design prototype (CareSync Prototype.html) handed off as enhancement spec on 2026-04-23. Triaged into 8 actionable stories; configurability surface (theme switcher, density/radius pickers, grain overlay, multiple hero variants, multiple dashboard layouts) deliberately cut to UX-22 to preserve a single opinionated look. Crisis/SOS scoped separately as UX-23. Real pattern aggregation deferred to UX-24 (UX-18 ships with mocks).

| ID | Status | Story | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| UX-14 | ✅ Shipped · PR #125 | **Command palette (⌘K)** | Modal triggered by ⌘K (Cmd+K mac, Ctrl+K elsewhere) from any logged-in screen. Sections: **Jump to** (routes), **Log** (med/mood/meal/BP/note/visit), **People** (ping member), **Admin** (settings, invite). Fuzzy search (simple `includes()` is fine for v1). Esc closes, ↑↓ navigates, Enter submits. New: `apps/web/components/CommandPalette.tsx` + test; hotkey listener mounted in `AppShellClient`. **People section omitted** (no `team.list` route or member-profile page found — revisit when those exist). 18 tests added. |
| UX-15 | ✅ Shipped · PR #126 | **Quick-log FAB** | Floating action button bottom-right of main content (not sidebar). Click expands to options: Meds, Mood, BP, Note, Meal, Hydration. Wired actions navigate to existing journal panels (`/journal/[recipientId]?panel=...`); meal + hydration shipped as **disabled "Coming soon"** (no schema yet — do not invent). Mounted in `AppShellClient` (every `(app)` route). 17 tests added. **Will conflict with UX-14 (#125) on `AppShellClient.tsx` — trivial additive resolve at second-merge.** |
| UX-16 | ✅ Shipped · PR #128 | **Fraunces + Geist type system** | Plumbing-only: added Fraunces + Geist Mono via `next/font/google`; exposed `--font-display`/`--font-body`/`--font-mono` in `@theme inline`; added 3 utility classes (`.headline-display`, `.headline-display em`, `.eyebrow-mono`) in `@layer components`. Italic em pattern is **scoped** to `.headline-display em` — no global `em` rule, existing literal `<em>` usage unchanged. `--font-sans` still resolves to Geist (no body-text regression). 6-assertion smoke test in `lib/__tests__/typography-tokens.test.ts`. **No existing component refactored** — UX-17 + UX-21 adopt the tokens. |
| UX-17 | ✅ Shipped · PR #138 | **Editorial dashboard refactor: BriefHero + MedCard + MoodCard** | Two-col layout (1.6fr/1fr). BriefHero card: blurred primary-subtle blob, mono pill eyebrow ("Today's brief · auto-generated 7:02a"), Fraunces 26 paragraph, status pills row. MedCard: check-style rows, strikethrough+60% opacity when taken, "Log" soft button when not. MoodCard: 13-bar sparkline (today in `--color-primary`, rest in `--color-primary-subtle`), Fraunces 28 mood label. Re-uses existing dashboard data; presentation-only refactor. Depends on UX-16. ~2 days. |
| UX-18 | ✅ Shipped · PR #127 | **Patterns strip in Journal** | Horizontal-scroll row of pastel cards above journal feed surfacing AI insights ("Eleanor more anxious on Tuesdays", "Sleep drops 90m after PT", "Mood highest when Priya visits"). v1 ships scaffold + 3 hardcoded mock patterns + tap-to-detail (`?filter=mood` query param). Real aggregation deferred to UX-24. New: `apps/web/components/journal/PatternsStrip.tsx` + test. Mounted at top of `JournalLayout` journal-destination block. 15 tests added. |
| UX-19 | ✅ Shipped · PR #129 | **Shift Handoff: "What did I miss?" view** | TopBar "What did I miss?" button (mounted in `JournalLayout` — no standalone TopBar exists) opens modal with 5 sections: Meds, Moments, Appointments, Concerns, Thanks. 24h/48h/72h period selector. Pure summary builder in `lib/handoffSummary.ts` with 18 tests; component with 12 tests. Uses existing `careEvents.timeline` tRPC query, client-side window filter. v1 manual trigger; auto-detect on `last_seen` deferred. Schema dump found: `entry_type` enum = journal/medication/shift/appointment/symptom/task/expense/handoff. **Will conflict with UX-18 (#127) on `JournalLayout.tsx` — trivial additive resolve.** |
| UX-20 | ✅ Shipped · PR #130 | **Print-friendly visit summary** | Dashboard "Generate visit summary" button → authenticated `/visit-summary` route (no token; caregiver prints, doesn't share). 6-section printable layout: patient info (PHI from `identity_vault` per P4-03 pattern), meds + adherence %, vitals SVG sparklines, symptoms, journal highlights, blank questions textarea. Uses `window.print()` — no `@react-pdf/renderer` needed. `lib/medAdherence.ts` pure helper with 14 tests; component with 18 tests. **Will conflict with UX-19 button placement if we add a Visit Summary button to TopBar later — but currently mounted on Dashboard, so no overlap with #129.** |
| UX-21 | 🟢 Ready | **Daily Brief: full-page editorial view** | Magazine-style article (`max-w-[720px]`) with Fraunces 48 headline ("A good morning for Eleanor"), mono dateline, 5-8 AI-generated paragraphs referencing care entries inline, doctor-friendly bullet section at bottom, "Email family" + "Print for visit" actions. Re-uses existing brief generation pipeline. Refactor of `apps/web/app/brief/[token]/page.tsx`. Depends on UX-16. ~1 day. |

Picked up automatically by the nightly agent. Rules: mark `✅` when done; list `**Blocked by:**` if a prerequisite is still open; one story per `###`; stay under ~4 hrs of work.

All items below are independent (no shared-state conflicts) — the agent may fan out in parallel.

### 🌙 ON-15 — Mobile: accessibility audit (iOS Dynamic Type + VoiceOver)
**Status:** ✅ Shipped (code complete; physical device VoiceOver verification deferred to human)

**Why:** Mobile uses fixed `fontSize` throughout; never tested against 200% Dynamic Type or VoiceOver navigation order.
**Work:** Run app under max Larger Accessibility Sizes on journal/medications/schedule; migrate fixed sizes to `PixelRatio.getFontScale()` capped at 1.5×. VoiceOver-complete a medication-log flow end-to-end. File follow-up ON-XX for issues deferred.
**AC:** app usable at 200% DT on 3 key screens; VoiceOver finishes the med-log flow.
**Size:** ~1 day. **Blocked by:** nothing.

## 3. Platform parity (PP-*)

Full table + stories: `docs/project-info/product/PLATFORM_PARITY.md`. Active items are listed in §1 above. Remaining:

| ID | Priority | Story | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| PP-002 | P2 | Mobile: onboarding wizard (first-run flow) | ✅ Shipped · PR #92 |
| PP-003 | P2 | Mobile: read-only subscription view + "manage on web" CTA | ✅ Shipped · PR #93 |
| PP-005 | P2 | Web: push notifications (browser Push API) | ✅ Shipped · PR #85 |
| PP-006 | P1 | Android prebuild + boot verification | ✅ Shipped · PR #90 |
| PP-007 | P1 | Android: push notification verification (FCM token + deep-link tap) | ✅ Shipped · PR #99 — needs `google-services.json` from Firebase for live FCM verification |
| PP-008 | P1 | Android: app-links verification (`assetlinks.json`, autoVerify) | 🧑 Needs human — `assetlinks.json` on live domain + EAS SHA-256 |
| PP-009 | P2 | Android: visual QA pass (screenshot every screen vs iOS) | 🟢 Ready — `scripts/android-visual-qa.sh` written; run when Android emulator available |
| PP-010 | P2 | Android: document-share intent verification | ✅ Shipped · 2026-04-17 — 17 unit tests cover Android `Alert.alert` picker path; fixed stale empty-state assertion |
| PP-011 | P2 | Offline behavior spec + write-queue for journal entries | ✅ Shipped · PR #88 |
| PP-012 | P3 | Consolidate URL scheme (`yourcarelog://` ↔ brand `carelog`) | ⏳ |
| PP-014 | 🟢 Ready | **Mobile subscription page: wire tRPC** | `apps/mobile/app/(app)/subscription/index.tsx` uses hardcoded REST fetch. Blocking dep (TD-22) cleared — `trpc.billing.getSubscription` now exists. Mobile wiring is ~1 hr. |
| PP-013 | 🧊 P3 | Wear OS companion | Parked for v2 |

---

## 4. Accessibility (A11Y-*)

Full plan + scoring: `docs/project-info/technology/ACCESSIBILITY.md`. Active in §1; overnight-eligible in §2. Remaining:

| ID | Priority | Story |
|---|---|---|
| A11Y-011 | ✅ Shipped · PR #119 | **Web button aria-label sweep** | All 4 targets already WCAG 2.2 AA compliant — no code changes needed. |

---

## 5. Large features (multi-day, not overnight-eligible)

### ON-54 — Free tier definition + soft gates · ~1 day
**Status:** 🧑 Needs product decision before coding
**Why:** PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md lists "free tier: limited (TBD)." BillingBanner soft-gate pattern is already wired. Needs a product decision on the limits (e.g. max 30 events/month, no history export, no document vault, 1 care recipient) before enforcement code can be written.
**Work once limits are decided:** BillingBanner gates on event creation, history export, and vault upload. No paywall — upgrade prompt only.
**Blocked by:** 🧑 Brady decides free-tier limits.

### ON-55 — Visit recorder · ~3 days
**Status:** 🧊 Deferred (Phase 7)
**Why:** Audio note at a doctor visit → Whisper transcription → Claude structured extraction → `care_event` tagged to the appointment. Roadmap explicitly labels this Phase 7 / future.
**Work:** Mobile: `expo-av` recording + upload to Supabase Storage. Inngest job: Whisper → structured parse → care_event insert with `entry_type='visit_note'`. Web: playback + structured fields editable.
**Blocked by:** Phase 1–6 features fully stable; sufficient data volume to validate the use case.

### ON-56 — Data stewardship commitment page · ~0.5 day
**Status:** ✅ Shipped · PR #102
**Why:** PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md says "publish before first paying users." Builds trust with a population burned by CareZone's shutdown. Commitment: 12 months notice before shutdown, full data export always available, data never sold, no ads ever.
**Work:** New marketing page at `/data-commitment` (or `/trust`). Link from footer + signup flow. Plain language, no legalese. ~0.5 day.
**AC:** Page live at stable URL; linked from site footer and onboarding.

### ON-59 — Inngest cron health monitoring · ~1 day
**Status:** ✅ Shipped · PR #110 (Sentry) + PR #111 (cron_runs timestamps)
**Why:** Weekly digest, refill alerts, burnout check-ins, and gap detector run as Inngest functions. If they fail silently, families miss digest emails and medication refill warnings — core retention and safety features. No monitoring exists today.
**Work:** Wrap each Inngest `serve()` handler catch block with `Sentry.captureException`. Add an Inngest event-stream webhook that fires to a `/api/inngest/monitor` route and logs failures to Sentry. Optionally add a `/api/health/crons` endpoint that returns last-run timestamp for each cron.
**AC:** Sentry receives an exception when any Inngest function throws. Oncall can see last-run timestamps for digest + refill + burnout + gap-detector.

### ON-60 — Referrer resource page `/for-referrers` · ~1 day
**Status:** ✅ Shipped · PR #107
**Why:** PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md identifies social workers, hospital discharge planners, elder law attorneys, and geriatric care managers as the highest-leverage GTM channel — one referrer who sends 2 families/month is worth more than 1,000 social media followers. There is currently no page targeting this audience.
**Work:** New marketing page at `/for-referrers`. Explains: what Carelog does, how to refer a family (share link), what families get. Includes a downloadable 1-page reference card (PDF). No commission language (conflicts with social worker ethics). ~1 day.
**AC:** Page live; includes share link + downloadable PDF; linked from main nav footer.

## 6. Deferred UI polish (UX-*) — intentionally parked

From `BACKLOG_UI_REDESIGN.md`. Ordered by impact.

### Shipped
- **UX-12** — ✅ Shipped · PR #120 — Empty states for AIChatThread + EntryDetailClient; MessageCircle + FileX icons, token-based styling.
- **UX-13** — ✅ Shipped · PR #117 — AIPanel: submit button disabled + Loader2 spinner while pending; onError shows sonner toast.

### Deferred
- **UX-08** — Storybook component library (post-launch, when component count warrants).
- **UX-09** — Visual regression testing (Percy/Chromatic or Playwright screenshot diffs).
- **UX-11** — Onboarding flow redesign — low traffic, functional as-is.
- **UX-22** — Configurability surface from 2026-04-23 design spec: theme switcher (sage/slate/rose), density picker (compact/comfortable/airy), radius picker (sharp/soft/pillowy), grain overlay, 5 hero variants, 3 dashboard layouts. Cut deliberately to preserve a single opinionated "editorial, calm, dignified" look. Revisit only if A/B data shows real demand.
- **UX-23** — Crisis/SOS mode. Subtle red SOS button → emergency contacts (911, primary doctor, family) + current meds + allergies + DNR/advance directive + one-tap "notify care circle." Parked separately from UX-14..21 batch — needs scoping with legal, accuracy guarantees on meds list, contact failover, and audit-log behavior before any code lands.
- **UX-24** — Real pattern aggregation for Journal Patterns strip. Replaces UX-18 hardcoded mocks with actual SQL/AI aggregation over `care_events` (mood-by-day-of-week, sleep-vs-event correlation, mood-vs-visitor correlation). Schedule after UX-18 ships and we have real production usage to validate the patterns are useful.

## 8. Human setup (pre-launch)

Canonical references:
- `docs/project-info/runbooks/THIRD_PARTY_SETUP.md` — all third-party service accounts + env vars
- `docs/project-info/runbooks/CI_HEALTH.md` — GitHub billing, secrets, repo settings

These tasks require signing into third-party consoles and cannot be automated:

**Third-party services (THIRD_PARTY_SETUP.md)**
- **Supabase cloud** — project, keys, HIPAA BAA (§1)
- **Vercel** — project + all env vars, `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` (§2)
- **Inngest cloud** — keys + register app post-deploy (§3)
- **Resend** — API key + domain verification (§4)
- **Upstash Redis** — rate-limiting database (§5)
- **Stripe** — account + product + prices + webhook endpoint in live mode (§6)
- **Sentry** — DSN + source maps auth token (§7)
- **PostHog** — project + key + privacy settings (§8)
- **VAPID keys** — generate once, set in Vercel (§9)
- **Firebase / FCM** — Android push (`google-services.json` → EAS) (§10)
- **APNs `.p8` key** — via EAS credentials (§11)
- **Deep-link verification files** — AASA (iOS) + `assetlinks.json` (Android) (§12)

**GitHub / CI prerequisites (CI_HEALTH.md)**
- **GitHub Actions billing** — payment method + spending limit; hard-blocks all CI when failed (§1)
- **`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret** — repo Settings → Secrets → Actions; gates AI security review on every PR (§2)
- **Allow auto-merge** — repo Settings → General → Pull Requests; required for overnight agent PRs (§3)
- **Branch protection on `main`** — current posture permissive; tighten post-launch (§4)

**Local dev (THIRD_PARTY_SETUP.md §14)**
- **Playwright Chromium** — `cd apps/web && npx playwright install chromium` — new machines hit a hard pre-commit failure without this

Claude work that's **gated on the above** (cannot start until the human completes the corresponding step):
- 🧑 **A2** — `supabase link --project-ref <ref>` + `db push` + bucket create + `supabase test db` against cloud *(needs Supabase cloud keys)*
- 🧑 **C3** — update weekly digest FROM address to `notifications@<verified-domain>` *(needs Resend verified domain)*
- 🧑 **PP-008** — Android app-links verification *(needs `assetlinks.json` on a live domain + EAS build SHA-256)*
- 🧑 **TD-03** — Sentry source maps *(needs `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` in Vercel)*

## 9. Definition of done (every story)

- [ ] Feature works end-to-end in local dev
- [ ] Role enforcement verified where applicable (wrong role → no access)
- [ ] Vitest and/or pgTAP coverage added for non-trivial logic
- [ ] No Turbopack JSX violations (no template literals in JSX props)
- [ ] Typecheck + lint + test suites green (`pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test`)
- [ ] For mobile UI: spot-check via `/mobile-ui` skill (screenshot at least one state)
- [ ] For web UI: axe hook green (post A11Y-001), respects tokens, keyboard-traversable
- [ ] TECH_DEBT.md updated if a known issue is resolved
- [ ] BUILD_STATUS.md checkbox ticked if relevant

---

## 10. Lifecycle update contract (all agents)

**Single source of truth.** Every planned piece of work lives here. Do not track work in ad-hoc docs, memory, or PR descriptions alone.

**When status changes, update this file in the same commit as the code change:**

| Transition | What to do |
|---|---|
| Picking up a story | Flip `Status:` to `⚡ In progress`, add `Owner:` + `Branch:` |
| Opening a PR | Flip to `🔎 In review`, add `PR: #NNN` |
| Hitting a blocker | Flip to `🔴 Blocked`, add `Blocked by:` with the reason or upstream ID |
| Merging | Move the row to §7 (shipped log) with a one-line summary; delete from §1–§5 |
| Discovering new work | Open a new row with `Status: 🟢 Ready`, pick the right prefix (`TD-*`, `A11Y-*`, `ON-*`, etc.), and leave it unowned |

**`/backlog-sync` runs this reconciliation automatically** against `git log`, open PRs (`gh pr list`), and the shipped log. Invoke it:

- At **session start** when resuming work on this repo
- At **session end** via `/session-end`
- On a **daily cron** via `/schedule` so the nightly agent sees fresh state
- Any time the §0 status board looks stale

Never delete a story silently — either move to §7 (shipped) or mark 🧊 with a reason.

---

## 11. Overnight-agent contract (what the nightly agent can assume)

- Before picking up any ON-* row, run `/backlog-sync` and claim the row by flipping its `Status:` to `⚡ In progress` + `Owner: nightly` in the first commit
- `pnpm` at the repo root is the entry point; each app has its own workspace scripts
- `supabase start` must be running for any pgTAP test
- macOS host; `./scripts/mobile-ui.sh` is available for any mobile visual check (iOS or Android)
- `/ollama` is available for mechanical fan-out; `/create-migration` for schema work; `/review` before committing RLS/PHI touches
- **Never** skip hooks (`--no-verify`). If a hook fails, investigate — don't bypass
- **Never** commit to `main` — every story lands on a branch + PR
- If a story is blocked by new information discovered mid-work, update the story's `**Blocked by:**` here and stop — don't improvise scope
